## Hi there👋 
### Welcome to my GitHub page.

### A BIT ABOUT ME:
I spent the last 10 years of my career as an auditor working for the Big Four in Japan. Shortly after coming to America I found a hidden passion I never knew existed -- coding! Now, with a few months of practice under my belt, passion unwavered, I'm eager to jump into a this new and exciting profession while building on my decade of experience in the finance sector.

I found [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/eri707) to be a great place to practice programming logic. I spend quite a bit of time there nowadays.

### COURSEWORK & EDUCATION:
Upon instruction of a fellow Sr Engineer, I started my coding journey at CodeCademy. I took the HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses there, and then followed up with a personally tuned battery of projects (visible in my Github).

I'm continuing to learn new things every day, never knowing when a new 💡 moment is just around the corner.

### MY STRENGTHS:
✏️  I'm consistent<br>
💪  I welcome challenges<br>
💖  I'm generally enthusiastic

### TIME IS MONEY:
One of the most important things to know about me is that I always strive to be efficient in my tasks -- whether professional or personal. We only have 24 hours in a day, so prioritization is key. I like lists, I like planning ahead, and I'm always looking to improve any and all processes at work and at home.
